                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>I am a Technical Writer with 2 years of experience creating clear, structured, and user-focused documentation for SaaS and cloud-based products. My work focuses on translating complex technical concepts into usable, accessible content that supports product adoption and improves user experience.</p>

                    <p>I have hands-on experience authoring end-to-end documentation, including online help systems, user guides, FAQs, integration documentation, and release notes. I work closely with developers, business analysts, and subject matter experts to understand product functionality, test features in QA environments, and ensure documentation accurately reflects real-world usage.</p>

                    <p>I follow structured authoring and docs-as-code practices, using tools such as DITA XML, MadCap Flare, Arbortext Editor, and Markdown, along with version control systems like GitHub. I am comfortable working in Agile environments and managing documentation alongside frequent product releases while maintaining consistency through style guides, templates, and content standards.</p>

                    <p>With a background in IT project management and experience working in global teams, I bring a strong sense of organization, attention to detail, and collaboration to my work. I am passionate about building documentation that not only explains how a product works, but helps users succeed with it.</p>
